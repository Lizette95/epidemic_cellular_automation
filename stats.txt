- FNR is higher
"The researchers estimated that those tested with SARS-CoV-2 in the four days after infection were 67% more likely to
test negative, even if they had the virus. When the average patient began displaying symptoms of the virus, the
false-negative rate was 38%. The test performed best eight days after infection (on average, three days after symptom
onset), but even then had a false negative rate of 20%, meaning one in five people who had the virus had a negative
test result."

- Severity
    - Mild to moderate: 81%
    - Severe: 14%
    - Critical: 5%
        - All deaths happen here with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3% (49% of those in critical condition)

    - "Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death. Among >44,000
    confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: ≥80 years, 14.8%;
    70–79 years, 8.0%; 60–69 years, 3.6%; 50–59 years, 1.3%; 40–49 years, 0.4%; <40 years, 0.2%."

    - age >= 65: 297.6 / 100,000

    - 0-17 yearsL Much much lower

- Infection prob does not change based on age (only the severity)
- No number for infection prob found
- No number for infection protection found for masks
    - Generally masks dont lower your chance of infection but it does lower the chance of people around you getting it
    if you are infected
- No number for infection protection found for social distancing
    - It helps lower infection prob for you and others (if you are infected)

REF 10
